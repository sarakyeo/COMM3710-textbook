    "text": "1.2 Why R?2\nIncreasingly, data are important components of decision-making. Whether you are looking at industry trends, generating financial statements and reports, analyzing market data, or creating visuals to communicate your work, you will need to know how to analyze data to efficiently, accurately, and professionally to develop reports and effectively communicate your findings.\nR is a tool that can help you do all this and more. This course will help you become familiar with this powerful data analysis tool. Often, students ask why we use R instead of Microsoft Excel in this course.\nHere are some reasons for using R over Excel.\n\n1.2.1 Ease of Use\nThere is little doubt that Excel is much easier to use than R. Most of us already know many Excel basics and the learning curve is minimal compared to R. This is partly due to the point-and-click nature of Excel, allowing us to make simple charts and tables.\nR, on the other hand, is a programming language. This means that the initial learning curve is, for most, likely to be steeper than that of Excel. However, with practice and time, R becomes easier quickly and you will soon realize that R is a powerful tool for analysis and generating visuals from data.\n\n\n1.2.2 Replicating Analysis\nHaving to use the point-and-click interface, or the graphical user interface (GUI), is a distinct disadvantage of Excel. Because you cannot import or use scripts, which are a collection of commands, in Excel, you must rely on memory to replicate your analysis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIn Excel, you must rely on memory to replicate data analysis. In R, you can simply re-run your saved script.\n\n\nR, on the other hand, is capable of reproducing analyses quickly and with different datasets. The commands for data analysis that you use in R can be saved as a script, which can then be run on multiple datasets. In other words, when we use R for data analysis, we do not have to “reinvent the (data analysis) wheel” as you would with Excel.\n\n\n1.2.3 Visualization\nFor simple graphics, Excel (with its minimal learning curve) can suffice. However, it is cumbersome to create attractive and professional-quality tables and figures in Excel.\nVisualization is where R excels (hah, see what I did there!). When datasets begin to get complicated or large, R is better equipped to handle them without making errors and can create impressive and easily customizable visual representations.\n\n\n1.2.4 Still wondering why we use R?\nIf you are still wondering why we are using R instead of Microsoft Excel for data analysis in this course, here are some examples that help illustrate the utility of R over Excel.\n\nHow the BBC Visual and Data Journalism team works with graphics in R\nThe Reinhart-Rogoff error - or How Not to Excel at Economics",

Source: ModernDive Chapter 1.\n\n\n\n\n\nThroughout this course, you will be using R via RStudio or Posit Cloud. This means that you will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer. If you are using Posit Cloud, you will not need to install anything on your computer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nIf you are using RStudio, you will need to install R and RStudio on your computer. If you are using Posit Cloud, you will not need to install anything on your computer.\n\n\nNew users often confuse R and RStudio. The analogy makes it clear that one cannot be functional without the other. Just like the dashboard of a car would not be functional without the engine and vice versa, RStudio and R are not functional without each other.\nRemember that R is a programming language for statistical computing and graphics. RStudio, on the other hand, is an integrated development environment (IDE) that provides an interface and adds convenient features. Just like your dashboard has an odometer, navigation system, etc., that makes driving easier, using RStudio’s interface makes statistical computing using R much easier.\nPart of this video by Andy Field describes the difference between R and RStudio. This video will also show you how to install R and RStudio, which are covered in Section 2.1.\n\n\n\n\nIsmay, Chester, and Albert Y. Kim. 2021.

    "section": "2.4 How do I use R?",
    "text": "2.4 How do I use R?\nUnlike Excel, which has a point-and-click GUI, R is an interpreted language. This means that you, the user, must type in commands written in R code. In other words, this course will teach you to code or program using the R language.1\nIn COMM 3710, we will learn R by “doing.” You are responsible for your own learning–the best way to master R is to practice deliberately.\n\n“While regular practice might include mindless repetitions, deliberate practice requires focused attention and is conducted with the specific goal of improving performance.” (Clear 2017)\n\n\n2.4.1 A quick tour of RStudio and Posit Cloud\nWatch this video by Andy Field to take a quick tour of RStudio.\nAs you have learned from Andy Field’s video, the RStudio and Posit Cloud interfaces consist of four panels (Figure 2.2).\n\nWait! I only see 3 panels…\n\nIf you happen to see only three panels, please select File \\(\\rightarrow{}\\) New File \\(\\rightarrow{}\\) R Script. Your RStudio/Posit Cloud should look like Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: Editor and Console windows in RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Some basic terminology and concepts\nThroughout the book, R code will be distinguished from text by using a different font. Let’s start with some basic terms.\n\nConsole: This is the panel in RStudio/Posit Cloud where you can view the output or results of your commands. Note that you can also enter commands in the Console panel. Pressing Enter after each command runs it, i.e., it tells R to execute the command.\nEditor: This is the panel in RStudio/Posit Cloud where you type commands in language that R understands. Think of this as a script containing instructions for R. You can save this script, which makes the work you have done reproducible.\nR script: A script is simply a text file containing a set of commands and comments. The script can be saved and used later to (re-)execute the saved commands. The script can also be edited so you can execute a modified version of the commands.\nObjects: Values in R are saved in objects.\nDataframes: These are representations of datasets in R where the rows correspond to observations and the columns correspond to variables that describe the observations.\nLogical operators: These are operators in R that represent “and” (&) and “or” (|).\nFunctions: Functions are also known as commands. Functions and commands tell R what you want it to do. Functions take the form of command() with parentheses (or parents). The parentheses are for arguments, which give R specifics about the function you want it to perform.\n\n\n\n2.4.3 Errors, warnings, and messages\nR shows errors, warnings, and messages in the Console window. Typically, it does so in red font, which can be intimidating for new users.\nDo not worry, you are unlikely to “break” R. And as long as you save your work frequently, you will not lose it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nAlways read errors, warnings, or messages carefully; they often provide information that will help you troubleshoot the issue.\n\n\n\n\n2.4.4 Tips for learning to code\nLearning to code can be frustrating at first. Frustrations are understandable and inevitable. But with deliberate practice, your coding and programming skills will improve.\nKeep the following tips from Ismay and Kim (2021) in mind as you learn to code in R:\n\nComputers are not that smart. You are the brains of the computer–it needs to be told what to do. Instructions must be clear and without ambuguity.\nCopy, paste, tweak. When you begin to learn coding, it is much easier to copy, paste, and modify code than start from scratch. When you first start to program, take existing code from the resources for this course, copy, paste, and tweak them to suit your goals. Once you become more comfortable with R, you will be able to recall functions and code from memory.\nLearning by doing. The best way to learn coding/programming is by doing. This is why COMM 3710 includes a lab component. Individual lab assignments and group project components afford you the opportunity to learn how to code and use R by completing tasks with a goal in mind.\nPractice, practice, practice. As with any skill, practice is necessary for improvement. Start on assignments early–anticipate that you will face challenges the first time you try an assignment. Use the resources provided in the course to help you troubleshoot. Most students do not start their assignments early enough to troubleshoot issues that arise. You can also use R for other courses–it is a versatile programming language that is powerful once you learn to use it. In fact, this book was made with R!\nR is case-sensitive. Most coding mistakes are typos. This is exacerbated when the programming language, such as R, is case-sensitive. Result, result, and RESULT are all different in R!\n\n\n\n2.4.5 R packages\nThere is a worldwide community of R users (e.g., search for #RCatLadies on X) who write code and bundle them into packages to extend the functionality of R.\nSome examples that we will use in this course include ggplot2 (Wickham, Navarro, and Pederson 2020), descr, and tidyverse.\nPackages in R are like apps on your phone–they extend the functionality of the base technology (Figure 2.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.3: R packages for R are analogous to apps for your mobile device.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are two steps to using apps to extend the functionality of your phone:\n\nInstall app on your device from app store. This is typically done only once. An app that has been installed on your phone does not require additional installation.\nOpen app from device. You must open the app every time you wish to use it.\n\nSimilarly, R packages need to be installed on your computer and then opened and then loaded in R (Figure Figure 2.4). Note where quotation marks are used and omitted in the commands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.4: Watch this gif to learn how to install and load packages in R. Note that the commands are typed into the Editor, not the Console–to run the commands written in the Editor, highlight and click Run in the top right corner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo install a package, type install.packages() in the Console window. The argument that needs to be provided is the name of the package. For example, if you are installing the descr package, you would use the command install.packages(\"descr\"). Like an app, you only need to install a package once.\nTo use a package, you must load it. This is like opening an app–it must be done everytime you open a new R session. To load a package, use the command library(). The argument within the parentheses is the name of the package you want to load. For example, to load the descr package, use library(descr).\n\nSome common errors related to installing and loading packages, which R displays in red in the Console, are shown below:\nError in library(descr) : there is no package called ‘descr’\nIf you get this error, this means that you have not installed the package.\nError: could not find function\nThis error means that you likely did not load the package for this R session. Remember, you need to load R packages each time you open R.\n\n\n2.4.6 How do I know whether I need to install or load a package?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.5: Flowchart to help determine whether you should load or install packages.",

    "text": "2.5 Learning by doing\nLet’s try out some commands. Open RStudio and start a new R script. If you need a reminder of how to start a new R script, review Section 2.4.1. To save your R script, see Section 3.6.\nTo start, let’s execute a simple command. In the Editor, type the following command.\n\n4 + 8\n\nTo run this command, which tells R to sum 4 and 8, highlight the command and click the  button in the upper right of the Editor window. You can also use the shortcut keys: Ctrl + Enter (Windows) or Cmd + Enter (Mac).\nYou will see the result of the command you just ran in the Console window.\n\n\n[1] 12\n\n\nNote that the [1] is produced by R. You can think of this as R telling you that this value, 12, is the answer to the first question you asked.2\nNext, try:\n\n3 * 3\n\nWhen you run this command, R will return the product of these two numbers.\n\n\n[1] 9\n\n\nAlthough it is good practice to write and execute commands line-by-line when you are first writing a R script, it can become tedious. To alleviate the tedium, you can run multiple commands at once by selecting all the lines that you want R to execute and using the keyboard shortcuts or the  button.\nType the following two lines in your Editor and try running them together:\n\n12 + 8\n16 / 4\n\nThe results in your Console panel should look like this:\n\n\n[1] 20\n\n\n[1] 4\n\n\nTable 2.1 shows some basic arithmetic operations in R.

You will need to assign a label to the container. R stores the information within the labeled container in the Environment ( Figure 2.6), which is the one of the tabs in the top right panel of RStudio.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.6: The Environment panel in RStudio/Posit Cloud.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe assign information to an object by using the assignment operator, &lt;-. The generic code for creating an object looks like:\nlabel &lt;- information\nLet’s say that we want to save the result of 2 * 10 to an object and call it kittens. In the Editor window, type and run the following R code:\n\nkittens &lt;- 2 * 10\n\nNotice that the result in the Console when you ran this command did not give you the result of 2 * 10.\nThis is because the result is stored as the object, kittens, and you have to ask R to display the result by calling the object. In the Editor, type kittens and run this command. You should see the result in the Console.\n\nkittens\n\n[1] 20\n\n\nNotice that the object, kittens, appeared in the Environment when you ran the command, kittens &lt;- 2 * 10 (Figure 2.7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.7: The Environment panel after you run the R code to create the object, kittens.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.5.2 Data types\nR can store objects with different types of data. Let’s create three objects containing different data types.\n\na &lt;- 19.81\nb &lt;- \"Hello, Salt Lake City!\"\nc &lt;- TRUE\n\nTo check the type of data contained in objects a, b, and c, use the class() function.\n\nclass(a)\nclass(b)\nclass(c)\n\nYour Console should show:\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\n[1] \"logical\"\n\n\na is numeric; b is a character string; c is a so-called “logical” data type that is either TRUE or FALSE. These data types can be organized into various data structures. For example, a data frame, such as the data files you will use in your assignments, is one data structure.\n\n\n2.5.3 R Functions\nAs mentioned in Section Section 2.4.2, functions are commands that tell R what you want it to do. Functions take the (generic) form of command() with parentheses (or parents). The parentheses are for arguments, which give R specifics about the function you want it to perform.\nFor example, the print() function will print the result of the argument or input within the parentheses.\n\nprint(\"Hello, SLC!\")\n\n[1] \"Hello, SLC!\"\n\nprint(5 * 10)\n\n[1] 50\n\nprint(3 &gt; 5)\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\n\n\n2.5.4 Working with data frames\nLet’s create a data frame to learn how to work with them. In the Editor panel, create a data frame by typing the following commands:\n\nid &lt;- 1:7\ncats &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 3, 5, 2, 3)\ngender &lt;- c('male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'male', 'female', 'female')\n\nWith the code above, you have created 3 objects, id, cats, and gender, using the concatenate() function, which can be shortened to c(). Assume these data represent 7 individuals who own a varying number of cats. And we have data on each individual’s gender.\nLet’s create a data frame from these individual objects.\n\nmydata &lt;- data.frame(id, gender, cats)\nView(mydata)\n\nAfter running the commands above, notice that your Environment panel now looks like Figure 2.8. Your data frame should look like Figure 2.9.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.8: Your Environment panel should look like this once you have run the above code.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.9: The dataframe you just created.\n\n\n\n\n\nUsing the mydata data frame, we will calculate the mean number of cats an individual in our data set owns.\n\nmean(mydata$cats)\n\n[1] 2.714286\n\n\nThe $ allows us to extract a column of data, or a variable, from the mydata data frame. The use of $ will be important when working with R throughout this course.\nTo see how many females vs. males are included in the data frame, use the following command.\n\ntable(mydata$gender)\n\n\nfemale   male \n     4      3 \n\n\nLet’s now look at only the number of cats owned by males in our data. This means we need to subset the data. To do so, we use square brackets, [] combined with logical operators. In this case, we will use the logical operator, ==, which means “equal to.”\n\nmydata$cats[mydata$gender == \"male\"]\n\n[1] 1 2 5\n\n\nTo calculate the mean number of cats owned by males, we can either create a second data frame that is the subset of mydata…\n\nMonly &lt;- subset(mydata, gender == \"male\")\nmean(Monly$cats) # in this case, we must use the column, cats, in the data frame that has been subsetted, Monly.\n\n[1] 2.666667\n\n\nor we can include the last command as an argument in the mean() function.\n\nmean(mydata$cats[mydata$gender == \"male\"])\n\n[1] 2.666667\n\n\n\n\n2.5.5 Logical operators\nWe used one possible logical operator, ==, in the example above. Other logical operators include:\n\n&lt;: less than\n&lt;=: less than or equal to\n&gt;: greater than\n&gt;=: greater than or equal to\n!=: not equal to\n==: equal to\n&: and (e.g., a & b means “a AND b”)\n|: or (e.g., a | b means “a OR b”)\n\nWe can also use ! to specify a condition as not something. Returning to our example of the mean number of cats males in mydata own, we could instead calculate the mean of cats owned by all individuals who are != \"female\" or “not female.”\n\nmean(mydata$cats[mydata$gender != \"female\"])\n\n[1] 2.666667\n\n\nFigure 2.10 is a visual representation of the differences between some logical operators.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.10: Differences between Boolean operators AND, OR, and NOT.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nClear, James. 2017. “The Beginner’s Guide to Deliberate Practice.” James Clear.

This means that one must invest time to learn R by doing. You can expect the learning curve to look something like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2\n\n\n\n\n\nExpect to ride the R rollercoaster (Figure 4.3).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.3: The R rollercoaster. Artwork by Allison Horst.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe following paragraph is an excerpt from Barrett’s (2021) blog post. The original post is worth reading and keeping in mind as you take this learning journey of R and, more broadly, data science.\n\nThis is the stubbornly quiet path of practice: our abilities lag behind our effort. At the ‘Ugghhhh’ stage, our internal motivation starts to dissolve. Sure, you can make a plot or whatever, but you’re still fighting errors all day. What do you have to show for it at this point? Not that much more, you might feel, than when you started. But our growth is rarely linear: often, it’s explosive, at least at critical moments. We suddenly begin to make connections, which help us build other relationships, and so on. Growth is never infinite, but it’s also rarely as linked to our immediate efforts as we expect.\n\n\n\n\n\nBarrett, Malcolm. 2021. “Data Science as an Atomic Habit.” Malcolm Barrett.

Remember that you only have to install the package once (see Section 2.4.5) to review R packages).\nBuilding ggplot graphics is typically a layered process. The function that we use is ggplot(). We use the + to add layers to the function.\nIn the function arguments (i.e., the commands within the parentheses), we define the data set that we want to use with data =, the aesthetics (x- and y-axes) with aes(), and the type of graph with geom.\nAs a reminder, the x- and y-axes on a graph are shown below (Figure 5.1).\nFigure 5.1: The x- and y-axes on a graph.\nIn the steps below, we will build the command sequentially.
